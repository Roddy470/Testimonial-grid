### Links

- Solution URL: [Add solution URL here](https://your-solution-url.com)
- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I decided to master the use of "nth-of-type" pseudo selector and I think I've gotten a good grasp of it.

### Continued development

I want to continue to use other pseudo selectors and classes in future projects, I feel it saves a lot of time and unnecessary class names

### Useful resources

- [Alexander D'Bridge Whatsapp channel](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va5hAvt8aKvNnkLnJl3Y) - This helped me with responsiveness. I really liked the pattern and will use it going forward.
